    "This task is focused on sentiment classification and span extraction from tweets. Please complete this task and upload your answers to Canvas as an iPython Notebook or a PDF. This assignment is due by 23:59 on December 10th 2023. Late submissions will be penalised by 1% for each day after this date. This is an individual assignment and your work must be your own.\n",

    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, given a tweet (text) we have two objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sentiment classification: Classify the tweet into one of three classes (positive, negative, neutral).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sentiment span extraction: Extract the sequence of words from the tweet that expresses the given sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example from the train dataset:\n",

    "| textID | text | selected_text | sentiment |\n",

    "| 266b8792a0 |Just broke my favorite necklace  superglue? | Just broke my favorite necklace | negative |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is divided into `train`, `dev` and `test` sets. The `train` set is used for the model training, while the `dev` set is used for validation and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test dataset has **no sentiment labels**. This dataset split will be used for **leaderboard submission** for sentiment classification modelling, described in section 2.\n",
